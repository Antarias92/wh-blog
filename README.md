Project Overview:
This project is a forum for Warhammer related questions. The user must register an account and login to access the website. The user’s account is stored in a MySQL database. The user’s password is encrypted and a hash is utilized when logging in. After logging in, the user can view different questions and answers based on categories. There is also a contact page to send messages. (The page for adding items is a work in progress for future updates.)
